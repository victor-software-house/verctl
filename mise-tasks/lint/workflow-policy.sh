#MISE description="The workflows follow the shared workflow policy: drafts, concurrency, labels, permissions, pins, mise_env"
#MISE tools = { conftest = "0.71.1" }
# conftest pulls the policy by commit into the git directory, so the
# repository carries no copy; --absolute-paths keeps a linked worktree's
# absolute git directory whole. Each pinned commit gets a folder of its own,
# filled once and never rewritten, so verify runs offline after the first run
# and no file of an older pin mixes in. Renders that share the git directory,
# such as cli/ and worker/, may run at once: a mkdir lock lets one of them
# pull, into a .part folder it renames when the pull is whole. An exit, or HUP,
# INT, QUIT or TERM, while it holds the lock removes both; a run killed outright
# leaves the lock, and the next run fails after 600 s with a message that
# names it. Each run writes the workflows' text to a file of its own.
# conftest parses each workflow as YAML, and the policy's texts.sh writes the
# workflows' text, which the pins rule reads for comments, as data beside it.
# It reads the policy's defaults.yaml, the repository's parameters and
# exceptions (.github/workflow-policy/config.yaml), and
# .github/actionlint.yaml's runner labels. Each --namespace is a rule the
# workflow_policy answer chose, or one of the repository's own packages in
# .github/workflow-policy/ that workflow_policy_namespaces names.
# GitHub runs only the repository root's workflows, so, as lint:workflows
# does, the task checks the root's workflows with the root's actionlint.yaml.
# A render below the root, such as cli/, reads its own .github/workflow-policy/
# when it keeps one, and the root's otherwise; each file is passed only where
# it exists, and a named package that no file defines fails the task. conftest
# fails on a missing folder, so it checks the tracked workflows only, and with
# none nothing runs and the check passes. -z hands xargs each path unquoted,
# whatever it holds.
